Open Master Hearing Aid (openMHA) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4569575.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4569575)

Current release: 4.17.0 (2022-02-24)

## Content of the openMHA

The software contains the source code of the openMHA Toolbox library, of the
openMHA framework and command line application, several tools to operate openMHA and of a selection of algorithm
plugins forming a basic hearing aid processing chain featuring

* calibration
* bilateral adaptive differential microphones for noise suppression [1]
* binaural coherence filter for feedback reduction and dereverberation [2]
* multi-band dynamic range compressor for hearing loss compensation [3]
* spatial filtering algorithms:
    * a delay-and-sum beamformer
    * a MVDR beamformer [4]
* single-channel noise reduction [5]
* resampling and filter plugins
* STFT cyclic aliasing prevention
* adaptive feedback cancellation [6]
* probabilistic sound source localization [7]

See below for a list of available reference implementations.

## Installation

For installation instructions for Linux, Windows and macOS, please refer
to the instructions in file INSTALLATION.md.

We also provide SD card images for Beaglebone Black with the Cape4all
sound card here: http://mahalia.openmha.org/.

## Usage instructions:

Please follow our getting-started guide:

Our user forum is found here:

## Known issues
### macOS
* There are some known issues with Octave under macOS. The openMHA GUI may not work correctly with octave. As an alternative Matlab can be used.

## Proprietary fitting rules
It is possible to fit a dynamic compressor in openMHA with the
commercial hearing aid prescription rules *DSLmio 5* and *NAL NL2*.

The software libraries implementing these rules must be obtained from
their respective authors.  The openMHA team provides wrappers around
these libraries which for legal reasons are not distributed as part of
openMHA but as optional extras.

Please refer to files README_NALNL2.md and README_DSLmio5.md for more
information.
