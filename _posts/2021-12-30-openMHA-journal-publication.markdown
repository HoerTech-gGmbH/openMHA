open Master Hearing Aid (openMHA) was developed and provided to the hearing aid research community as an open-source software platform with the aim to support sustainable and reproducible research towards improvement and new types of assistive hearing systems not limited by proprietary software. The software offers a flexible framework that allows the users to conduct hearing aid research using tools and a number of signal processing plugins provided with the software as well as the implementation of own methods. The openMHA software is independent of a specific hardware and supports Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems as well as 32-bit and 64-bit ARM-based architectures such as used in small portable integrated systems.
