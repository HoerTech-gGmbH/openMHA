Requirements:

- qt for GUI support, comes with octave version >= 4.0

If octave crashes, when GUI is started try

LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 octave

OR update mesa driver

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

=== Revert to original drivers ===
To revert to standard Ubuntu drivers type the following in a prompt shell:
$ sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
$ sudo ppa-purge ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers

- octave signal package is needed for some fitting rules

> sudo apt-get install octave-signal
In ocatve run 
> pkg load signal
at startup

In octave 4.2.1 I used
> pkg install -forge control
> pkg install -forge signal

- Error message
error: octave_base_value::convert_to_str_internal (): wrong type argument '<unknown type>'

is connected to the required use of the qt graphics toolkit 
http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?46466

--> Installed octave 4.2.1 manually - resolved

Issues:

% fitting rules that crash
- loudfit: gt_basic is missing
- CAMFIT: field 'frequencies' does not exist
- NAL: nl1.mex is missing

% Data handling
Whole client database is stored in a single file - makes octave slow
--> Use one-file-per-event approach?

% Data compatibility
Octave is not able to save complex structs in Matlab format!
Other formats are slow.
This is the problem:
https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?43215#discussion
Function handles cannot be saved in Matlab binary format. Thay are contained in the setting structure to be saved. Removing them before saving takes too much time (and may cause errors at other places, when the struct is re-loaded).

v4: struct and cell not supported
v6,v7: function handles not supported
v7 + stripping off handles: slow
using native binary format: incompatibility between Octave and Matlab

Do we really need to save/store these handles?!

No, does seem so. Converting the handles to strings after using it seems to be a suitable workaround!

-----

% Client data is not updated/ saved after editing audiogram!
! solved

===
% Remove
- Audiometer in fitting GUI
- Administration in mhacontrol main window


======
MatLab

- Issue with plotting the fit in the main window at startup needs to be fixed.
