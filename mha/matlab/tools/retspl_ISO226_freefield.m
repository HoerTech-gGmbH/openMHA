% This International Standard specifies combinations of sound pressure
% levels and frequencies of pure continuous tones which are perceived
% as equally loud by human listeners. The specifications are based on
% the following conditions: the sound field in the absence of the
% listener consists of a free progressive plane wave; the source of
% sound is directly in front of the listener; the sound signals are
% pure tones; the sound pressure level is measured at the position
% where the centre of the listener's head would be, but in the absence
% of the listener; listening is binaural; the listeners are
% otologically normal persons in the age range from 18 years to 25
% years inclusive.
