# This configuration demonstrates a beamformer algorithm that is part
# of the openMHA release.  We demonstrate directional filtering
# performed by the beamformer for a specific hearing aid microphone
# setup, where each hearing aid has 2 microphones.  The beamformer
# filters have been optimized for the specific microphone locations as
# described in Kayser, H., Ewert S. D., Anemüler J., Rohdenburg, T., 
# Hohmann, V., Kollmeier B., “Database of multichannel in-ear and 
# behind-the-ear head-related and binaural room impulse responses,” 
# EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing, Volume 2009, 
# Article ID298605, 10 pages, 2009, 
# available at http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/hrir/
#
# To test the beamformer, we provide the example sound file
# AudioFiles/2speaker_4ch_16k.wav, that contains the 4 microphone
# channels in the order [front-left, front-right, rear-left,
# rear-right].
#
# The beamformer in this example is steered towards the +20° direction
# (frontal, a little bit to the right, sound from that direction is
# preserved), which is the direction of the female speaker in the
# example sound file.  The example produces the output sound file
# beamformer_out.wav
#
# Execute this example from the main directory with
# bin/mha ?read:mha/configurations/beamformer.cfg cmd=start cmd=quit
# after setting up the system as described in the main Readme.
