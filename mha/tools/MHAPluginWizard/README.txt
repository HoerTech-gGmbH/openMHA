MHAPlugin Wizard for Qt Creator 3.5.1.

Installation notes:
Copy this whole directory "MHAPluginWizard" under one of the following locations:

   share/qtcreator/templates/wizards (in your Qt/QtCreator installation)
   the local user's configuration folder, $HOME/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/templates/wizards
   %APPDATA%\QtProject\qtcreator\templates\wizards

Then restart QtCreator, go to File Menu->New File or Project. "MHA Projects" category should be visible, click on "MHA Plugin (two classes)" and click Choose. Give the plugin a name and location, select a Kit (I can explain this in more detail), fill out template variables on the "Details" page, and click "Finish" on the summary page.
