% sGt = gainrule_camfit_linear(sAud, sFitmodel)
% sAud.frequencies contains the audiogram frequencies
% sAud.l.htl       contains the subject-specific hearing threshold levels in
%                  dB HL for the left ear
% sAud.r.htl       the same for the right ear
% sFitmodel.frequencies contains the center frequencies for the amplification bands
% sFitmodel.levels      contains input levels in SPL for which to compute the gains
% sGt              contains 2 matrices, l and r that contain gains in dB
%                  for every input level (rows) and band (columns)
% sGt              may also contain an expansion_slope field.
% Linear cambridge rule for hearing aid fittings.

% Please note that this gain rule by default applies a noise gate below 45 dB
% band level.  If you want a different noise gate level, please set the global
% variable CAMFIT_NOISEGATE before this function is called.  Please note that
% the gain rule now limits the gains so that in each band 100 dB output level
% is not exceeded. If you need higher output levels, please set the global
% variable CAMFIT_MAXOUT before this function is called.
