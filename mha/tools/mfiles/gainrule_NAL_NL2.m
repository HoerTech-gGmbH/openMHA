    % Input Parameters: (all frequencies given in Hz)
    % sAud - Auditory profile information: A struct with the following fields:
    % sAud.client_id - 8 character ID of the hearing impaired person, containing
    %                  initials and date of birth.
    % sAud.id        - ID of the audiogram of this hearing impaired person. By
    %                  default it contains the date of the audiogram measurement,
    %                  but this can be changed by the person entering the data.
    % sAud.l         - audiogram data for left ear
    % sAud.r         - audiogram data for right ear
    %
    % The audiogram data is itself a struct and may contain the following fields,
    % here exemplified only for the left ear:
    % sAud.l.htl_ac  - Hearing thresholds for air conduction
    % sAud.l.htl_bc  - Hearing thresholds for bone conduction
    % sAud.l.ucl     - Uncomfortable levels
    %
    % Each of these three fields is only present if the corresponding measurments
    % have been entered in the audiogram entry dialog by the user.
    % The measurement data can be extracted from the following fields, here only
    % exemplified for the air conduction thresholds:
    %
    % sAud.l.htl_ac.data - a vector of structs containing the air conduction
    %                      thresholds for the left ear.
    %                      Each struct element of the vector has the fields f, hl:
    % sAud.l.htl_ac.data(n).f  - nth measured frequency for the left ear.
    % sAud.l.htl_ac.data(n).hl - corresponding air conduction threshold in dB HL.
    %
    %
    %
    % sFitmodel - information about the dynamic compressor to fit:
    % sFitmodel.frequencies - Center frequencies of the dynamic compression bands.
    % sFitmodel.edge_frequencies - A vector containing in this order:
    %                    - The lower cutoff frequency of the lowest frequency band
    %                    - Crossover frequencies between adjacent bands
    %                    - The upper cutoff frequency of the highest frequency band
    % sFitmodel.levels - The input band levels in dB SPL for which to compute
    %                    insertion gains.
    % sFitmodel.channels - The number of ears to fit (1 or 2).
    % sFitmodel.side     - Which ears to fit: 'l', 'r', or 'lr'
    %
    % The vector sFitmodel.edge_frequencies always contains one more element than
    % the vector sFitmodel.frequencies.
    %
    % Note that the audiogram frequencies may differ from the dynamic compressor
    % frequencies, and may also differ across ears and threshold types. Interpolation
    % or extrapolation may be required as a consequence in order to compute the gains
    % for all requested compression bands.
    %
    % Outpout parameter:
    % sGt - A struct containing the dynamic compression gaintables in the following
    %       fields:
    % sGt.l - A (LxB) real-valued matrix containing applicable insertion gains in
    %         dB for the left ear.
    %         L is the number of input levels in sFitmodel.levels.
    %         B is the number of center frequencies in sFitmodel.frequencies.
