# Setup of analysis branch
#
# The analysis branch will typically run with lower processing
# priority and with larger block sizes than the filter path. Data from
# the analysis path can be transferred back to the filter path via AC
# variables.
#
# In this example, the RMS level in the last second is calculated and
# handed over to the filter path (this is for illustration only, level
# meter plugins with much higher performance are available).
