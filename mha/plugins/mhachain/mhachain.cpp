(mhachain,
 "plugin-arrangement data-flow",
 "Load a sequence of plugins."
 " During processing, the signal is passed from plugin to plugin,"
 " and may change its domain or dimension.\n\n"
 "If profiling is switched on, the cumulative time spent in the processing"
 " callback of each plugin is stored in a monitor variable.\n\n"
 "Plugins are loaded by assigning a vector of strings to the configuration"
 " variable {\\em algos}.  Each entry in this vector has the form"
 " \\textit{plugin}\\textcolor{orange}{\\textit{:configured\\_name}}"
 "\\textcolor{blue}{\\textit{<config\\_file}}, where"
 "\\begin{itemize} \\item \\textit{plugin} is the filename of the plugin"
 " without path or file extension,"
 "\\item \\textcolor{orange}{\\textit{:configured\\_name}} optionally assigns"
 " a different name to this instance of the plugin. This is useful if multiple"
 " instances of the same plugin are loaded into different positions of the"
 " processing chain. the colon and the"
 " \\textcolor{orange}{\\textit{configured\\_name}} are not"
 " specified, then the \\textcolor{orange}{\\textit{configured\\_name}}"
 " defaults to \\textit{plugin}."
 "\\item \\textcolor{blue}{\\textit{<config\\_file}} optionally specifies a"
 " configuration file with which the plugin is initially configured."
 " This is only needed when replacing a complete chain while the mha is"
 " performing signal processing by reassigning {\\em algos}."
 "\\end{itemize}"
 "The plugins loaded by assigning to configuration variable {\\em algos}"
 " cause creation of sub-parsers named like the"
 " \\textcolor{orange}{\\textit{configured\\_name}} in the mhachain plugin"
 " configuration and can be configured through these sub-parsers."
