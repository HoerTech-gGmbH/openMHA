The configuration files in this directory, generic-hearing-aid,
combines plugins for calibration, adaptive differential microphones,
STFT processing, coherence filtering, a filterbank, dynamic compression,
and a pitch shifter. In combination this constitutes a generic hearing aid,
similar to example 4 but optimized for usage on weak hardware.
Some example settings for the dynamic compressor are also provided.

openMHAcontrol.flow provides a flow file for a node-red based GUI. 
The node 'node-red-dashboard' is required for this flow.

The processing is started like this:
mha ?read:generic-hearing-aid.cfg cmd=start

To use this example in an mahalia beaglebone setup, copy the config file, the 'generic-hearing-aid'
and 'headphones' directories into /etc/mahalia and copy the flow file to /etc/nodered. 

Usage in other contexts may require you to adapt the paths in the configuration files.
