This example demonstrates how to use the lsl2ac plugin to receive marker streams. It contains three files:

Makefile: To conveniently compile SendStringMarkers.cpp 
SendStringMarkers: Sends string markers into the network via an LSL stream named "MyEventStream"
string_markers.cfg: openMHA configuration file

To run this example, first compile SendStringMarkers:
> make SendStringMarkers

Then start SendStringMarkers and in a separate shell, start mha and inspect the recieved values:

> ./SendStringMarkers
...
> mha ?read:string_markers.cfg --interactive cmd=start
> mha.acmon.MyEventStream?val
