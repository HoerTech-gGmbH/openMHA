# 'Channels' takes a vector of integers, each
# element represents a group of one or more channels
# that will be grouped into a thread. The value of
# the element is the number of channels in the group

# into two groups of one channel each

# Assign a plugin to every channel group.
# Identical plugins need to be named by the
# ":" operator

#In this example, use the mhachain plugin twice
